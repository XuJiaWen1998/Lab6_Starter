Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin is one of those incredible miracle recipes\u00a0that just happens to only require 4 ingredients - pork, bacon, honey and olive oil. Just sear the pork, then roll up in bacon, drizzle with honey and bake!Had one too many sad, dried out roast pork tenderloins? This happens because this cut has almost no fat. By wrapping it in bacon, it not only protects the pork but the bacon juices bastes the pork, helping it stay nice and juicy!","datePublished":"2021-09-15T14:30:00+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bacon-wrapped-pork_69-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bacon-wrapped-pork_69-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bacon-wrapped-pork_69-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bacon-wrapped-pork_69-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["4"],"prepTime":"PT5M","cookTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT35M","recipeIngredient":["8 to 10 slices of streaky bacon (, long enough to wrap around the pork 1 1/2 times.)","1 lb / 500g   pork tenderloin (, at room temperature)","Salt and pepper","1 tbsp olive oil","2 tbsp honey ( or maple syrup (honey works better, it&#39;s thicker))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat oven to 200\u00b0C/390\u00b0F (180\u00b0C fan).","name":"Preheat oven to 200\u00b0C/390\u00b0F (180\u00b0C fan).","url":"https://www.recipetineats.com/bacon-wrapped-pork-tenderloin/#wprm-recipe-22520-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Lay out bacon: Lay the bacon strips vertically on a board, slightly overlapping (see photo in post).
